## Concept

One of the main struggles with B2B referral programs has always been the underwhelming rewards compared to the invested time, the engagement from clients and the unscalable and inconsistent efforts to keep the referral program relevant. Another issue is the fact that such referral programs are presented in a boring and mediocre way. With Bierens, the main issues concern the capability to create a beneficial B2B referral program, and the lack of an appropriate solution to the problem.

To find a permanent solution to this very actual problem, our group from Fontys University of Applied Sciences has come up with a creative and innovative B2B referral program.

Our B2B referral program strives to help Bierens with their problem in a beneficial way for all parties involved. Our program strives to reward the invested time by clients. Each referral matters and there should be a sufficient reward for it. Having the possibility to network with people within the program, changing the rewards, allowing the user to choose a reward and having the option to spin a wheel when they are unsure is what makes our solution effective, fun and interactive. Our B2B referral program solution is a mix of tier-based rewards, points system as well as networking between referral partners as well as security measurements such as our decay system and point mitigation system.
